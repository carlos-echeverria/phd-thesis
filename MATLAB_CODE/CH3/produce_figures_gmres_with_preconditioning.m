%   Written at the Technische Universitaet Berlin.
%
%   This script perfroms numerical experiments for solving the system:
%   Ax = b, where the matrix A is obtained from the discretization of the
%   following 1D conv-diff problem posed on a Shishkin mesh with one
%   transition point:
%
%   -epsilon * u'' + alpha * u' + beta * u = f in (0,1),  u(0) = u(1) = 0.
%
%   The system is solved via GMRES preconditioned with the multilpicative
%   Schwarz method using the function: gmres_shishkin_precond.m.
%   For each set of parameters epsilon, alpha,
%   beta, and N, the function produces a Figure that compares the
%   performance of GMRES when the matrix is obtained via the upwind
%   finite diference scheme as well as the central diference scheme.
%   Performance for the scaled versions of the resulting matrices is also
%   included in the comparison. The figure is then saved in an eps file in
%   the working directory.
%
%  subordinate functions:
%          
%        gmres_shishkin_precond.m
